ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Beena Suryavanshi
I am a full-stack software engineer and writer. I love programming, reading, writing and speaking.
As a software engineer, I enjoy using my obsessive attention to detail, my unequivocal love for making things that change the world.
that's why I like to make things that make a difference.
